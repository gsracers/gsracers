Specializing in creating physical vehicles, particularly ATVs. Over the years, GSRacers has participated in more than 17 national-level events, and an international event , consistently showcasing their dedication, innovation, and technical prowess. Our hard work and commitment were rewarded in 2014 when we secured All India Rank 1, a significant milestone in our journey. The team has a long-standing tradition of competing in M-BAJA, having been a part of this prestigious event for 17 consecutive years. Embracing new technologies and expanding their horizons, GSRacers ventured into the electrical segment last year. Demonstrating their versatility and innovative spirit, they successfully developed two vehicles from different segments, highlighting our ability to adapt and excel in a rapidly evolving field.</h2>
